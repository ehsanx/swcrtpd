SW-CRT Power Distribution

We upload some basic code for our SW-CRT power distribution calculation in supply of our paper submitted to BMC medical research methodology. The code has not been well-documented. Please use at your own risk. Please note the computational time is massive on your local computer as the author finished all computation on cloud computing.

We delayed the documentation as we are developing a R-package for more efficient power distribution estimation. We also extend the outcomes to other types (binary, count). A well-documented version with reasonable computational time will be available in June, 2020. Please check back then.
