SW-CRT Power Distribution

These codes are provided to support a manuscript that has been submitted for review.  These codes are not well-documented and are to be used at your own risk

We delayed the documentation as we are developing a R-package for more efficient power distribution estimation. We also extend the outcomes to other types (binary, count). A well-documented version with reasonable computational time will be available in June/July, 2020. Please check back then.
